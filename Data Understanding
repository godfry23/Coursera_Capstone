<h1>Data Understanding</h1> 
<hr>
# Data used for this project is the collection of all collisions provided by the Seattle Police Department and recorded by Traffic Records since 2004 until the present.
# 
# The target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' since it allows to classify the severity of accidents from 0 to 3 within the dataset.
# The severity codes are as described below:
#     0 - Unknown
#     1 - Property Damage
#     2 - Injury
#     2b - Serious Injury
#     3 - Fatality
#
# The attributes that will be use to weigh the severity of an accident are 'INATTENTIONIND', 'UNDERINFL', 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND', 'LIGHTCOND',
# 'PEDROWNOTGRNT', and 'SPEEDING'. LOCATION will lastly be used to map the accidents to better visualize the distribution of accidents.
#
# The attributes descriptions are as shown below:
#     - INATTENTIONIND: Whether or not collision was due to inattention (Y/N)
#     - UNDERINFL: Whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
#     - WEATHER: A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision.
#     - ROADCOND: The condition of the road during the collision.
#     - LIGHTCOND: The light conditions during the collision.
#     - PEDROWNOTGRNT: Wheter or not the pedestrian right of way was not granted (Y/N)
#     - SPEEDING: Whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision (Y/N)
#     - LOCATION: Description of the general location of the collision.
#
<h2>Data Cleaning and Converting</h2>  
<hr>
# The data collected is not fully formated to be properly used for our analysis. Therefore, the data will have to eliminate all non used 
# attributes for our models. Secondly, all remaining data will need to be converted to numerical type and all null or missing data will 
# to be either discarded.
#
# Lastly, severity codes will be grouped into two categories 
#     0 = For SEVERITYCODE 0, 1, 2
#     1 = For SEVERITYCODE 2b and 3
# This will allow to analyze and generate models which evalute if the accidents results in Serious Injury / Fatality or not.
# 
# With the data properly corrected and modified, we will be able to use it in our analysis and models.
