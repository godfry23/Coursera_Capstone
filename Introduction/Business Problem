<h1>Introduction/Business Problem</h1>
<hr>
# In Seattle every year countless car accidents occur and in some instances they sadly result in severe injuries or deaths. 
# Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to look at the circumstances where the events occur as to be able to pin point
# the most critical factors which result in severe injuries or deaths. 
# 
# The project will result in the development of an algorithmic model which will help predict the severity of an accident based on 
# different factors such as the weather, road condition, visibility and so on.
#
# Following this report, the Seattle autorithies will have at their disposition a better insight on how to efficiently reduce these 
# kind of accidents. They will be able to do so by directly trying to reduce of the most significant attributes which will have been
# highlighted in the model.
