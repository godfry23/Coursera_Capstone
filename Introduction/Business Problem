# Therefore, the ultimate goal of this project is to look at the circumstances where the events occures as to be able to pin point
# the most critical factors which result in severe injuries or deaths. The project will result in the development of an algorithmic 
# model which will help predict the severity of an accident based on different factors such as the weather, road condition, visibility and so on.
# Following this report, the Seattle autrithies will have at their disposition a better insight on how to efficiently reduce these 
# kind of accidents.
